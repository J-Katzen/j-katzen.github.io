    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3><b>Hello World!</b></h3>


<p>Today I decided to take on the task of learning a thing or two about Jekyll, Octopress, and taking advantage of github pages to open a new blog that I&#8217;ve taken the liberty title &#8216;Is this code?&#8217;</p>


<p>To be honest, initial setup took me a little longer than I had originally anticipated because of my lack of experience doing anything with ruby and rbenv.  For a little while, even though I had installed ruby1.9.3p448, I was still using my system&#8217;s ruby1.8.7. The rbenv versions command helped me identify which version I could quickly enable with the rbenv local command.
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>rbenv versions
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$ </span>rbenv <span class="nb">local</span> <span class="o">[</span>version<span class="o">]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
</p>


<p>After that was squared away, I was off to the races. I found a nice theme which I have applied and left unmodified for now after taking a look at this <a href="http://j-katz.net//github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes">list</a>. I changed the font, because I didn&#8217;t want to lay any money down for the typekit font this theme was loading, so I opted for <a href="http://j-katz.net//www.google.com/fonts">Google Web Fonts</a> because they are free and have a great selection. It also helps that Octopress has great integration with them already, which is all well-documented on their site <a href="http://j-katz.net//octopress.org/docs/theme/template/">here</a>. Basic configuration setup followed, along with some link changing and voil√†, you get what you see here now.</p>
