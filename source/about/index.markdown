<h3><b>Why the title: 'Is This Code?'</b></h3>
<p>My programming learning experience has pretty non-traditional (at least in my own opinion) and I don't think this fact is unique as many others out there have learned how to program themselves as well. I always try to strive to program things as best as I can, however I also know that there are instances when frustration, lack of practice or understanding, and time constraints can lead me to have some crappy ass code as well. So by no means is this a tutorial or how-to blog, as more of a 'this is what I did, while I cannot guarantee that it is the best solution'-type deal. So while I try to post what I've learned or what I've done, by all means offer better solutions if you know them as this can only help! Also, if I've written something and helped you out, then awesome - maybe give a shoutout or something if you feel like it.</p>
